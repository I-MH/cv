# Research Interest

My primary research interests lie in  (nonstationary) functional time series, and (nonstationary) spatio-temporal  datasets. I have developed novel methodologies for large-scale and complex data by assuming that data are continuous functions. This approach allows analyzing data from different sources as well. Some examples of my research are related to the robust estimator on functional autoregressive model, modelling nonstationary functional time series, and modelling nonstationary spatio-temporal datasets. I am currently developing novel methodologies for healthcare technologies using the functional data approach. I am also interested in environmental data science.
