## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Research Interest

- My primary research interests lie in developing novel statistical methodologies for analyzing:
  -  large-scale and complex time series data, and
  -  spatio-temporal data.
- I am highly motivated by real world problems such as data from  Environment, Energy, Health, and Engineering. <br>
- I am excited  about  functional data analysis (FDA) approach, which I find very promising and flexible in modeling this type of data. FDA assumes that data are in the form of continuous functions and can overcome several challenges faced in real applications. Some topics I am interested in include:
  -  modeling, 
  -  exploratory data analysis,
  -  hypothesis testing, 
  -  forecasting, 
  -  classification, and 
  -  efficient estimation.
- I am currently developing novel methodologies for healthcare technologies for 2050 @ [QUEST](https://healthcare-quest.com). QUEST is a EPSRC funded project joint with colleagues at the University of Glasgow. <br>
